          <h1><span class="yourName"></span>, your dream destination is New Zealand!</h1>
          <p>Widely held to be one of the most breathtaking countries on the planet, New Zealand is a phenomenal travel destination. The rugged mountains and remote valleys that thrust the destination into the world's spotlight through The Lord of the Rings trilogy tell only part of the story. You'll also find beaches, fjords, lakes and gorgeous swathes of forest, not to mention age-old Maori culture, forward-looking cities and, famously, a world-class array of outdoor activities.</p>

        <div id="destination2">
          <h1><span class="yourName"></span>, your dream destination is Switzerland!</h1>
          <p>Combining expansive greenery, slick cities and bucketfuls of fresh air, Switzerland is a stylish tourist destination offering countless outdoor adventures and contemporary urban breaks. Switzerland's Alpine vistas are so picture perfect, they can appear plucked from the pages of a storybook. But these disarming landscapes are alive and kicking, as a spot of skiing, hiking or mountain biking will attest.</p>

        <div id="destination3">
          <h1><span class="yourName"></span>, your dream destination is Puerto Rico!</h1>
          <p>Think palm-fringed beaches, colourful colonial buildings and a harmony of Caribbean, Hispanic and American cultures, and you've got Puerto Rico in a nutshell. A coconut shell, of course. Add to this swathes of tropical rainforest, warm turquoise waters and year-round sunshine and you have all the hallmarks of a perfect holiday destination.</p>
